<unique_id/account_number>$$<account_name>$$<encrypted_password>$$<address>$$<phone_number> (ending me \n)


this just a basic idea about how the user's information will be stored

For delimiters between each field we will us "$$"

and to get the details for the user we will make varification thorugh <unique_id>,<decrypted_password> and <phone_number>

for each creation of the account we will make a new file for that account, with the file's name being the <account_number>.txt
